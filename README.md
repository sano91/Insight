# Unsupervised learning Guide
### Introduction
Unsupervised learning subsumes all kinds of machine
learning where there is no known output, no teacher to instruct the learning algo‐
rithm. In unsupervised learning, the learning algorithm is just shown the input data
and asked to extract knowledge from this data. So there is no way for us to “tell” the algorithm what we
are looking for, and often the only way to evaluate the result of an unsupervised algo‐
rithm is to inspect it manually.
### Purpose
Hopefully and maybe, there is some setups, when we can find useful separations, and grouping in the result.
